Design and Implementation of Scalable Enterprise Networks: Integrating Advanced Cybersecurity with Modular Cloud  Components. 


# Lab Recreation Repository

Welcome to the **Lab Recreation Repository**. This repository contains all the essential materials needed to recreate the lab we performed. Below is a detailed description of the contents included in this repository.

## Contents

### üìÇ `topology.zip`
This zip file contains the lab topology. You can import it directly into EVE-NG or PNetLab to set up the lab environment effortlessly without extracting the zip file.

### üìÑ Lab Sheet
The lab sheet file includes the initial configuration of the devices:
- **IP Addressing**
- **Layer 2 Technologies:**
  - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
  - VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
  - Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)

### üîí Security
The security file provides a comprehensive security hardening walkthrough, detailing steps to secure the lab environment effectively.

### üó∫Ô∏è Routing
The routing file outlines the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) setup, guiding you through the process of configuring dynamic routing protocols.

### üöÄ Ansible Playbooks
We are actively working on converting these configurations into Ansible playbook templates as a step towards **Infrastructure as Code (IAC)**. This will enhance automation and ensure consistency in our setups.

### üõ†Ô∏è WAZUH
The WAZUH folder contains various useful scripts designed to automate the complex and tedious tasks involved in setting up WAZUH. These scripts streamline the deployment process significantly.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cifer-sudo/Design-and-Implementation-of-Scalable-Enterprise-Networks-.git
   ```
2. **Import `topology.zip` into EVE-NG or PNetLab.**

3. **Follow the Lab Sheet for Initial Configuration:**
   - Configure IP addressing
   - Implement Layer 2 technologies (STP, VTP, DTP)

4. **Apply Security Hardening Steps from the Security File.**

5. **Set Up OSPF Routing as Outlined in the Routing File.**

6. **Explore Ansible Playbooks (Work in Progress) for Automating Configurations.**

7. **Utilize WAZUH Scripts for Simplified Setup.**
